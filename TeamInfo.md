## Project Summary

  Our project is a data analysis website on the Steam Game Database. Here users can search up specific data within the dataset, such as looking at most popular games by genre or year. Users can search up games based on criteria that they like, such as the genre or if the game is free. For each game a user should be able to see all the details related to said game. A user can also compare games side by side. 
	
 Furthermore A user can visually interpret the data with dynamic graphs, where a user can input parameters and have data visualized based on these parameters. Another complex feature would be a game recommendation system, based on a user’s interests. Moreover we plan on implementing a game popularity prediction feature to aid game developers. This feature will utilize NLP and other data analysis techniques.
